After receiving your deposit and information, we will send you the details for paying the balance. Until the deposit has been made, we will not confirm your booking and a contract will not come into existence.
                                    The balance of the trip must be paid in full at least one week prior to the start of the trip. If the balance is not paid within the specified period, the booking will be considered cancelled and the cancellation fee will be charged as detailed below.

Alternatively, both parties may agree that the deposit for the trip may be considered as a deposit for another trip within one to two years. If you cancel your booking after full payment, you will be charged the following fees:

                                    43-59 days before the start of the trip: 20% of the trip cost

                                <p>You should always have medical insurance arranged before traveling to Mongolia. Medical bills, especially when a medical evacuation is needed, can be substantial. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation. Foreign nationals requiring medical treatment in Mongolia, are required to pay 80% of the total cost when receiving treatment. The remaining balance paid after treatment. We advise you wear a helmet when riding animals. If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial +976 103 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance/medical assistance company as soon as possible to inform them of what has happened. There have been isolated incidents of bubonic plague in some rural areas of Mongolia, caught by consuming marmot meat. The meat is a delicacy in some rural areas although it is illegal to hunt for marmot in Mongolia. 
                                    When travelling in rural areas, you should avoid marmot meat and follow the latest advice from the local authorities. If you think you have been exposed to Bubonic Plague whilst traveling in Mongolia, you should immediately report to the nearest hospital and call the National Infectious Disease Centre on +976 100. Due to the size of the county, those injured in remote parts of the country may have long travel times before reaching the nearest medical facility. The cost of treatment is fixed, and most procedures are costed so you should be able to confirm the cost before treatment. You should always carry a first aid kit, have supplies of over-the-counter medicines you may require for your trip. You should always bring any regular prescription drugs you may need with you, and spare, just in case.</p>

                                <p>Traveling across the Mongolian countryside can be difficult and potentially dangerous if you are not familiar with the terrain. Mongolia does not have an extensive road network. You may need to follow tracks in the dust, mud, or sand and there will not necessarily be other traffic to follow if these give out. People traveling in Mongolia should be aware of local road conditions, and weather forecasts and have researched the areas they will travel through. The knowledge of a local guide or driver can be an advantage. 
                                    Global Positioning Systems do not always function reliably and there are large areas of the country without mobile phone coverage. It is recommended that you take backup communications like a satellite phone, plenty of water, and provisions. Make a contingency plan and make sure someone knows your route and expected times of arrival and departure.</p>
