                        This is your chance to join Mongolia’s nomadic herders as they embark on their seasonal migration from their winter quarter to their spring quarter. You will be amazed by the breath-taking beauty of winter covered western Mongolia, plus the challenges nomads face in the course of their migration process amidst this appealing yet harsh season. In the far west of this vast yet sparsely populated country - roams the Kazakhs, who are the country’s largest ethnic minority group, speaking their mother-tongue and preserving their unique cultural heritage.
                        <br><br>
                        You will live with a Kazakh family and get a glimpse into their nomadic way of life. Learn about their daily chores, such as: preparing food, tidying their home, raising children, tending livestock, and training eagles for hunting.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class = "bold">About winter-spring migration:</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Nomadic families move an average of 3 to 4 times annually, and the winter-spring migration is considered to be the toughest. Livestock begin to produce offspring beginning from around March 20th, therefore it is most favorable to have already moved to their spring location by then. The time to move depends on the passing winter conditions. If there was a lack of grass at the winter spot during the year, then families move from there early. If winter conditions were suitable, then some families move after the lunar new year, around February 20th or thereafter. Families can manage to move early because they have already gathered hay and prepared their spring camp during the previous autumn. Another reason for migrating early is because the livestock lose much of their weight and vigor during winter, and it is advantageous to arrive at the destination before the animals lose more strength and are unable to walk. For many nomads, it takes 3 or 4 days to move from their winter camp to spring camp. During these days, it’s not an unusual occurrence for some nomads to lose some of their animals due to weakness. We are giving this explanation because some people may become distressed by such an incident.
                        <br><br>
                        Western Mongolia’s spring weather can change suddenly and it can be just as cold as mid-winter during February. Sometimes there are very heavy snowstorms and strong winds. Because of these conditions, you must come well-prepared, especially with good-quality clothes to keep you warm while you capture memorable photos and videos.

There are two white rivers originating from two sides of Mongolia’s highest mountain range called Altai Tavan Bogd, meaning the “Five Holy Peaks” of the Altai. This particular river originates from south of the Altai Mountains and eventually drains into Khoton Lake. It is one of the most beautiful rivers in Mongolia, known for its stunning scenery. 

                                    The Bear Valley is virtually untouched by livestock or human activities, thus retaining its pristine nature. While ascending through Bear Valley, we will come across freshwater rivers flowing down from the mountains, a high waterfall, beautiful heart-shaped lake, steep cliffs, and perhaps some wildlife.
                                    
                                    There will be camel support from today onwards. Cars will head back to Ulgii. Total hiking time is approximately 5 hours.
