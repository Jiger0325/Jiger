    <p class= "What_To_Eat_In_Bayan-Ölgii_Text">Kazakh cuisine, basically, consists of dairy products, meat. The extreme continental climate in Bayan-Olgii influenced this nomadic people’s traditional diet. Kazakh nomads consume meat and dairy products from their domesticate animals. Meat is either cooked, used as an ingredient for soups and dumplings or dried for winter. Milk and cream are used to make a variety of beverages, as well as cheese and similar products. Seasoning is not used in traditional cooking, but Kazakhs add salt into their foods (including tea). Kazakh typically cook with a wok, so most foods are stir-fried or boiled. A steamer is usually available for cooking dumplings. Vegetables, fruits and spices were quite limited. Since a few years ago, in Bayan-Olgii, you can find a big range of vegetables and spices, especially, in supermarkets of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city. Kazakh cuisine is influenced by neighboring countries such Russian, Chinese and Korean cuisine, due to geographical position and historic ties.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="What_To_Eat_In_Bayan-Ölgii_Text">Ulaanbaatar is a growing metropolitan city, so, in capital city of Mongolia, you can find many different cuisine restaurants: Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, German, French, Italian, American as well vegan and vegetarian tec. But, in other cities, you have limited choice of international cuisine. Bayan-Olgii’s restaurants range between small canteens to chain restaurants and fine dining. In Ulaanbaatar, you will find easily cafes or coffee shops, pastries, bakeries, especially in center. In countryside, hotels and ger camps have restaurants with Western and Kazakh cuisine. Kazakh nomads are very hospitable people. When you visit them, they will offer you to drink and eat. Do not refuse drinking and eating, at least you need have a sip of tea and taste the food. If you refuse, it is considered impolite.</p>

    <p class= "Comfortable_Accomodation_Text">Day-by-Day accommodation types are indicated in each tour program. In Ulaanbaatar we provide 3/4 star hotels on comfortable double room base with breakfast, whilst we arrange tourist camp, tented camp, or herder- nomad family stay in the countryside. Tourist camps offer hotel-styled mongolian gers for sharing 3-4 persons per a ger.
        Outside Ulaanbaatar the best comfortable option is to stay in tourist ger camps. These have been set up in the most popular places to cater for travelers. These traditional gers have brightly colored furniture and wood burning stove in the center. Usually each ger have three or four beds, and the camp provides clean sheet and blanket. The Ger camps also have a separate washing block that contains western style flushing toilets and shower rooms. And all camps have a restaurant where they serve Mongolian and European food. The gers are really enjoyable and authentic form of accommodation, warm in the winter, and cool in summer. The best way to book is through local travel company, who would have most up-to-date information.</p>
